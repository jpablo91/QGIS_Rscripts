title: "Incremental Spatial Autocorrelation"
---


**This tool allow to create n incremental spatial autocorrelation plot using Moran's I.**  

The input parameters are:  
* *Layer:* Must be a point data layer with some values.  
* *Field:* A numeric variable that will be used for the Morans I analysis.  
* *Begining Distance:* The starting distance.  
* *Steps:* Number of steps for the analysis.  
* *Distance Increment:* How much the distance will increment in each step.   

The output should provide a Table in the layers section and a R Plot that will open in a htm window
